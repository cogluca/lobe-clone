# Lobo

### Simple Tour page taken from Lobo.ai
Reason for making this is that in my teens I've always wanted to create sentient robots and it has been a dream
of mine, probably inspired by The LawnMower and a few book from Asimov. Well, this isn't exactly a machine learning model but it has been a blast revisiting my dream while developing this simple landing page.
Hope you like it !
